    "text": "The roadside ITS-Ss or cellular base stations receive data packets of a radio technology convert them to the data packets for another radio technology and transmit them for the ITS-Ss equipped with the latter radio technology The successful implementation of the proposed framework requires that the original transmission occurs in proximity to infrastructure equipment with conversion capability and the latency introduced by the conversion and retransmission meets overall latency budget requirements Figure 9 illustrates an example of the solution described above Figure 9 Example architecture for IBC The processing through the different protocol layers of the ITS-S architecture which is included in the converter depends on different requirements for the conversion operations One basic assumption is that ITS-Ss employ the same higher layer protocols such as networking transport and facility layer as well as their supporting security and management protocols In Figure 10 the simplest conversion architecture is depicted with a radio access layer-only processing In this case the complexity in the converter is minimal and the additional latency due to the conversion operation is expected to be low Address conversion among different technologies need to be taken into account especially if access layer addresses are used or referenced outside the protocol headers Furthermore protocols might rely on control messages that have no equivalent in the other technology",
