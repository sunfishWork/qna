    "text": "The configurations for CA operating band including Band n41 also apply for the corresponding CA operating bands with Band n90 replacing Band n41 but with otherwise identical parameters For brevity the said configuration for CA operating bands with Band n90 are not listed in the tables below but are covered by this specification Non-contiguous resource allocation and almost contiguous allocation are not applicable for each NR carrier of intra-band contiguous and non-contiguous CA configurations For a CA configuration with one or more operating band supporting asymmetric channel bandwidths as specified in sub-clause 536 requirements are defined for an asymmetric UL and DL channel bandwidth combination of a supported asymmetric channel bandwidth combination set for an operating band of the CA configuration when the said UL and DL channel bandwidths are also contained in a supported bandwidth combination set of the CA configuration For a higher order band combination of which CA_n20-n28 is a subset the frequency range in band n28 is restricted for the higher order band combination to 703-733 MHz for the UL and 758-788 MHz for the DL The configuration tables for CA describe Bandwidth Combination Sets Bandwidth Combination Set 4 and 5 contain all possible defined channel bandwidths for each band in the combination The fact that BCS4 and BCS5 contain all channel bandwidths for each band does not alter if a bandwidth is mandatory or optional for a given band Bandwidths that are identified as optional in Table 535-1 for a given release are still optional for UEs that support BCS4 or BCS5 where the bandwidths the UE supports for each band the maximum bandwidth andor minimum bandwidth for the band in the band combination are indicated in the UE capabilities The minimum bandwidth per CC and maximum aggregated FDD TDD and total bandwidth per band combination may be indicated only for BCS5 as described in 38306 15 and BCS5 shall not be indicated together with BCS4 for a CA configuration For inter-band CA combinations including FR1 intra-band CA and with BCS4 or BCS5 in the following configuration tables the Bandwidth Combination Sets for the FR1 intra-band CA are BCS4 or BCS5 respectively By default unless otherwise notedstated and except for NR band restrictred to operation with share spectrum access channel power class 3 applies to - all valid NR FR1 band single uplink configurations - all specified NR FR1 band intra-band uplink CA configurations - all specified inter-band CA configurations For NR bands with operation restricted to shared spectrum channel access by default power class 5 applies to all valid single uplink configurations and to all specified intra-band uplink CA configuration",
